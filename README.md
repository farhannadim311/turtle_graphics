# 🐢 Turtle Graphics – MIT 6.005 Assignment

This project is an implementation of **turtle graphics** in Java, inspired by the MIT 6.005 course.  
It includes functions for drawing shapes, calculating geometric properties, computing heading adjustments, and creating custom generative art.

## 📌 Features
- **Shape Drawing**
  - Draw squares and regular polygons of any side count.
- **Geometry Calculations**
  - Compute the interior angles of regular polygons.
  - Calculate the number of sides from a given interior angle.
  - Compute heading adjustments between points.
- **Path Navigation**
  - Calculate successive heading turns needed for a sequence of coordinates.
- **Personal Art**
  - Custom, colorful pattern using `Turtle`'s `forward`, `turn`, and `color` methods.
